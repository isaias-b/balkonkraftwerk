00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,958
Last week i bought a 
balcony solar power plant

2
00:00:03,958 --> 00:00:07,125
Cause the utility companies already 
stole enough from everyones hand

3
00:00:07,125 --> 00:00:09,958
Now it has been enough with 
your annual price increases

4
00:00:09,958 --> 00:00:12,541
Just keep sitting around while
your profits start to cease

5
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:15,458
Cause if everybody of us is able to gather 
only 600 Watts of solar power

6
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:18,458
We can easily save a tenth 
of your coal and gas power

7
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:21,250
Those who legitimately calculate the 
disposal cost of nuclear waste

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,458
Will easily figure out that your numbers 
have an extremely bad taste

9
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:27,458
The public starts to mobilize 
with petitions on the internet

10
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:30,458
But Altmaier rather sucks on 
his glacier ice instead

11
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:33,458
Renewable Energy

12
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:36,458
has never been as cheap as these days

13
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:39,458
Solar electricity from your own roof top

14
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:42,458
For everyone, who would have thought

15
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:45,458
The industries fight with gas and fees

16
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:48,458
Still against the batteries

17
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:51,458
But juice will flow like an endless brook

18
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:54,041
And this bass will reach the neighbourhood

19
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:56,666
Scholz cheekily calls his 
climate goals ambitious

20
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:59,458
With that he proudly demonstrates 
that he simply doesnt get it

21
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:02,458
Your own electricity instead of 
coal electricity would be beneficial
for the german nation

22
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:05,458
but social equity is politically 
under heavy regulation

23
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:08,458
A fact about CO2 is 
that every ton counts

24
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:11,458
But the big companies dont earn 
from private electricity

25
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:14,458
Because climate taxes, will be expensive, 
for the friends of Mister Scheuer

26
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:17,458
A new fuel for the boys 
would be enormously practical

27
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:20,458
Therefore hydrogen is now topic
on every regulators table

28
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:23,000
*Regulators conversation*
How can we scam the most 
money from the people?

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,916
*Regulators conversation*
Hey Olaf, Scheuer just told something 
about e-fuels, that's fantastic isn't it?

30
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:29,000
*Regulators conversation*
Yea do it do it do it!

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Renewable Energy

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
has never been as cheap as these days

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Solar electricity from your own roof top

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
For everyone, who would have thought

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The industries fight with gas and fees

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Still against the batteries

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But juice will flow like an endless brook

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,583
And this bass will reach the neighbourhood

39
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:55,333
Everyone go and buy a balcony solar power plant, 
Thats how we'll bring the fossil stronghold to its end

40
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:58,333
Once we eagerly generate electricity
Even the throne of buerocracy starts to swing

41
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:01,333
The juice flows into the wall outlet
Money-grabbing patent hunters report nothing to do

42
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,500
What else shall i say except
Shout it out into the neighbourhood

43
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:18,666
Renewable Energy

44
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:21,666
has never been as cheap as these days

45
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:24,666
Solar electricity from your own roof top

46
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:27,666
For everyone, who would have thought

47
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:30,666
The industries fight with gas and fees

48
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:33,666
Still against the batteries

49
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:36,666
But juice will flow like an endless brook

50
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:39,250
And this bass will reach the neighbourhood
