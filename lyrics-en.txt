Verse1:
Last week i bought a balcony solar power plant
Cause the utility companies already stole enough from everyones hand
But now it is enough with your yearly price increase
Just keep sitting around while your profit starts to cease
Cause if everybody of us is able to gather 600 Watts of solar power
We can easily save 10% of your brown coal and gas power
Those who seriously calculate costs of disposals for nuclear waste
Will easily figure out that your numbers have an extremely bad taste
The public starts to mobilize with petitions on the internet
But Altmaier rather sucks on his glacier ice instead

Refrain:
Renewable Energies
No other days were they cheap as these
Solar electricity from your own roof top
For everyone, who would have thought
The industries fight with gas and fees
Still against the batteries
But juice will flow like an endless brook
And this bass will reach the neighbourhood

Verse2:
Scholz cheekly calls his climate goals as ambitious
With that he proudly demonstrates that he simply don't to get it
Own electricity instead of coal electricity would be beneficial for the german nation
but social equity is politically under heavy regulation
Fact about CO2 is that every tonne counts
But the big companies dont earn on citizens electricity amounts
Cause climate taxes, that will be expensive, for the friends of Mister Scheuer
A new fuel for the boys would be enormously practical
Therefore hydrogen is now topic on every regulars' table

Regulars' table conversation:
How can we pull out the most money from the people?
Hey Olaf, Scheuer just told something about e-fuels, that's fantastic isn't it?
Yea do it do it do it!

Refrain:
Renewable Energies
No other days were they cheap as these
Solar electricity from your own roof top
For everyone, who would have thought
The industries fight with gas and fees
Still against the batteries
But juice will flow like an endless brook
And this bass will reach the neighbourhood

Bridge:
Everyone go and buy a balcony solar power plant
Thats how we bring the fossile stronghold to its end
Once we busily generate electricity
Even the throne of buerocracy starts to swing
The juice flows into the SchuKo wall outlet
Money-grubbing patent hunters report nothing to do

What else shall i say except
Shout it out into the neighbourhood

Refrain:
Renewable Energies
No other days were they cheap as these
Solar electricity from your own roof top
For everyone, who would have thought
The industries fight with gas and fees
Still against the batteries
But juice will flow like an endless brook
And this bass will reach the neighbourhood
